# YASKAWA-Robot-Teleoperation

An interface to control a YASKAWA GP7-YRC1000 industrial robotic arm through a teleoperation method. This project uses a 3DS Haptic Teleoperation device to control the robot. 

## Project configuration

The program is written in `Visual Studio 2019 C++`. However, we need to install Visual Studio 2010 since the haptic driver only supports the v100 platform toolset.
